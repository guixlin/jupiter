# Backtesting Design Document for Cross-Sectional Strategy

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Background
A cross-sectional strategy involves analyzing a universe of assets (e.g., stocks, ETFs) simultaneously and applying a set of rules or models to identify trades across the entire universe. The goal is to exploit relative mispricings or inefficiencies in the market.

Backtesting is the process of testing a trading strategy on historical data to evaluate its performance and robustness. This document outlines the design for a backtesting system specifically tailored for cross-sectional strategies.

### 1.2 Objectives
- To design a robust framework for backtesting cross-sectional investment strategies.
- To ensure that the backtester can handle large datasets, multiple assets, and diverse market conditions.
- To provide clear metrics for evaluating strategy performance and risk-adjusted returns.

## 2. Scope of Backtesting System

### 2.1 Strategy Types
The system should support various cross-sectional strategies, including:
- **Mean Reversion**: Exploiting short-term price deviations from historical averages.
- **Momentum Investing**: Capturing trends in asset prices.
- **Value Investing**: Identifying undervalued assets based on fundamental metrics.
- **Size-Based Strategies**: Betting on small-cap versus large-cap stocks.

### 2.2 Data Sources
The backtester should support data from:
- Historical price and volume data (e.g., intraday, daily, weekly).
- Fundamental data (e.g., financial statements, valuation ratios).
- Market-wide factors (e.g., sector performance, macroeconomic indicators).

## 3. Design Overview

### 3.1 Architecture
The backtesting system will consist of the following components:

#### 3.1.1 Data Collection Layer
- **Data Ingestion**: Pull historical and real-time data from multiple sources.
- **Data Storage**: Store raw and processed data in a structured format (e.g., databases, CSV files).

#### 3.1.2 Strategy Development Layer
- **Strategy Implementation**: Encode the cross-sectional strategy logic in code or rules-based frameworks.
- **Parameterization**: Define and test different parameters for the strategy.

#### 3.1.3 Backtesting Engine
- **Simulation**: Execute the strategy on historical data, generating trading signals and positions.
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculate performance metrics such as Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, drawdowns, and returns.

#### 3.1.4 Risk Management Layer
- **Position Sizing**: Implement risk management rules (e.g., fixed fractional, volatility targeting).
- **Portfolio Construction**: Optimize the portfolio based on cross-sectional signals.
- **Risk Metrics**: Monitor VaR (Value at Risk), liquidity risk, and other relevant metrics.

#### 3.1.5 Reporting Layer
- **Performance Reports**: Generate detailed reports of strategy performance over time.
- **Visualization Tools**: Create charts and graphs to visualize backtest results.

## 4. Detailed Design Components

### 4.1 Data Handling
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing data, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- **Data Transformation**: Normalize or standardize data for consistent analysis (e.g., z-scores for mean reversion).
- **Cross-Sectional Aggregation**: Combine data across assets to compute universe-wide metrics.

### 4.2 Strategy Implementation
- **Signal Generation**: Develop rules-based signals for entry and exit points.
- **Position Sizing**: Implement position sizing logic (e.g., equal-weighted, risk-parity).
- **Execution Logic**: Simulate trading execution, including slippage and commission modeling.

### 4.3 Backtesting Process
1. **Historical Simulation**:
   - Run the strategy on historical data from a specified start date to end date.
   - Generate backtest results, including performance metrics and trade logs.

2. **Forward Testing**:
   - Test the strategy on out-of-sample data to evaluate its predictive power.

3. **Stress Testing**:
   - Simulate extreme market conditions (e.g., 2008 financial crisis) to assess robustness.

4. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Sharpe Ratio: Risk-adjusted returns.
   - Sortino Ratio: Downside risk-adjusted returns.
   - Maximum Drawdown: Worst peak-to-trough loss.
   - Win Rate: Percentage of profitable trades.
   - Correlation with Market: How the strategy performs relative to a benchmark.

### 4.4 Risk Management
- **Position Limits**: Enforce maximum position size per asset or sector.
- **Volatility Checks**: Adjust exposure based on market volatility.
- **Stop Loss/Take Profit**: Implement automated stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms.

## 5. Implementation Steps

### 5.1 Step 1: Define Strategy Logic
- Document the strategy logic, including entry/exit rules, position sizing, and risk management.
- Code the strategy in a programming language (e.g., Python, R).

### 5.2 Step 2: Set Up Data Infrastructure
- Choose data providers or APIs for historical and real-time data.
- Build a database to store and retrieve data efficiently.

### 5.3 Step 3: Develop Backtesting Framework
- Write code to simulate the strategy on historical data.
- Implement performance metrics and reporting tools.

### 5.4 Step 4: Test Strategy Robustness
- Perform backtests under different market conditions.
- Validate the strategy using statistical tests (e.g., hypothesis testing, bootstrapping).

### 5.5 Step 5: Optimize and Refine
- Adjust parameters to improve performance while avoiding overfitting.
- Conduct forward testing to ensure the strategy works on unseen data.
